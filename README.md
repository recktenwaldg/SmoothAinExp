# SmoothExpAin: An Arduino library for exponentially-weighted smoothing of analog readings

The `smoothAinExp`
provides an object-oriented interface for exponential-weighted smoothing of noisy
analog input channels.  The `demoSmoothAinExp` sketch in the Examples folder
shows how this library can be used.

The primary advantage of using the `smoothAinExp` library is that it allows
smoothing on multiple inlet channels.
